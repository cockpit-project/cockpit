  <title>Privileges and Permissions</title>

  <para>When a user is logged into Cockpit, they are logged into a normal session
    that has exactly the same privileges as if they logged in via SSH or on
    the console.</para>

  <para>In some cases Cockpit will try to escalate the privileges of the user
    using <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/polkit/">Policy Kit</ulink>
    or <ulink url="http://www.sudo.ws/">sudo</ulink>. If the user is able to escalate
    privileges from the command line, then Cockpit will use that same capability to
    perform certain privileged tasks. Cockpit can use the user's login password internally to
    escalate privileges unless the user has chosen to prevent that from happening.</para>

  <para>To test out whether Cockpit can escalate privileges, you can run these commands
    from a the <link linkend="feature-terminal">terminal built into Cockpit</link>.</para>

<programlisting>
$ sudo cockpit-bridge
...
$ pkexec cockpit-bridge
...
</programlisting>

  <para>If either of these commands succeed without prompting for a password,
    Cockpit will be able to start a privileged copy of the
    <filename>cockpit-bridge</filename> and use it to perform privileged tasks
    when necessary. When running these commands from the terminal built into Cockpit
    neither should prompt for a password.</para>

  <para>Usually a user needs to be in the <code>wheel</code> Unix user group for the
    user to be able to escalate privileges in this way. However both Policy Kit and
    sudo may be configured to use other criteria.</para>
