      Cockpit is a server manager that makes it easy to administer your Linux
      servers via a web browser.
      Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem.
      A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal.
      Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the
      Cockpit journal interface.

      Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform
      simple tasks such as storage administration, inspecting journals and
      starting and stopping services.
      You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time.
      Just add them with a single click and your machines will look after its
      buddies.
