# Note: Because of its use of cockpitflow, libwebsocket_a_LIBS should
#       rightfully include a reference to libcockpit_common_a_LIBS, but it
#       can't do this because libcockpit-common.a depends, in turn, on
#       libwebsocket.
#
#       At this point, libwebsocket should probably just be merged into
#       libcockpit-common, but we can't do that because the log domain is
#       different, and some of the tests depend on that.
