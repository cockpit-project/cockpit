== NetworkManager

If available on the system, Cockpit uses
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager[NetworkManager] and the
DBus APIs it provides to interact with the system's network
configuration.

For non root users, NetworkManager controls access to its APIs via
link:#privileges[Policy Kit] and a user logged into Cockpit will have
the same permissions as they do from the command line.

To perform similar tasks from the command line, use the
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Networking/CLI[nmcli] command:

....
$ nmcli general status
STATE      CONNECTIVITY  WIFI-HW  WIFI     WWAN-HW  WWAN
connected  full          enabled  enabled  enabled  enabled
....

Devices marked as "not managed" with the `NM++_++CONTROLLED=no` setting
will not be displayed in the interface.
