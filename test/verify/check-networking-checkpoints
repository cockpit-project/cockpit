        # A slow rollback would normally cause the global health check
        # to fail during rollback and prevent showing the
        # #confirm-breaking-change-popup.  We expect the global health
        # check failure to be ignored.
        #
        # We test slow rollbacks by slowing down DHCP requests.
        #
        # We need at least 60 seconds of network disconnection to let
        # the health check fail reliably.  A rollback is started 7
        # seconds after disconnection, so we need to delay the DHCP
        # request by at least 53 seconds.  However, NetworkManager has
        # a default DHCP timeout of 45 seconds, so we need to increase
        # that.
        #
        # Sometimes, NetworkManager extends the DHCP timeout by an
        # additional 480 seconds grace period.  This doesn't always
        # happen, so we don't rely on it.

        dhcp_delay = 60

        # There are a couple of considerations for ordering the
        # following actions:
        #
        # - Changing the main.dhcp config value requires a restart of NM.
        #
        # - A restart of NM might run dhclient, and we don't want it
        #   to be slowed down already at that point.
        #
        # - After restarting NM, we need to wait for it to settle
        #   again before messing with dhclient.
        #
        # - Simply setting ipv4.dhcp_timeout is not enough if it
        #   should be used immediately for a checkpoint rollback, see
        #   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1690389.  A
        #   additional restart is enough.
        #
        # So we set ipv4.dhcp_timeout and main.dhcp, do a restart, log
        # into the UI and wait for the expected interface to appear
        # and be active, and then slow down dhclient.
