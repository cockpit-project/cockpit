Cockpit, a remote manager for GNU/Linux servers
===============================================

Cockpit runs in a browser and can manage your network of GNU/Linux
machines.

CAVEAT:

    This is pre-release software.  Only install it in a system that
    you are ready to lose.  It is a good idea to make a virtual
    machine (or three) to play around with Cockpit.

Cockpit is not yet ready for actual use, that's why there aren't any
installation instructions.  But if you want to play with the code,
please see the HACKING file.
