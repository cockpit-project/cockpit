== SELinux Policy

If present on the system Cockpit can set the SELinux mode to enforcing
or permissive. It can also use `setroubleshootd` to show audit issues
and apply suggested fixes.

To perform similar tasks from the command line use the `setenforce` and
`sealert` tools.

To clear out all the information that `setroubleshootd` tracks, you can
use a commands like:

....
$ sudo killall setroubleshootd
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/setroubleshoot/*
....
