== Single Sign On

Cockpit can use Kerberos for Single Sign On authentication, where users
are automatically authenticated if they have a valid Kerberos ticket.

[[sso-server]]
=== Server Requirements

To authenticate users, the server that Cockpit is running on must be
joined to a domain. This can usually be accomplished using the
https://freedesktop.org/software/realmd/docs/realm.html[`realm join example.com`]
command.

The domain must be resolvable by DNS. For instance, the SRV records of
the kerberos server should be resolvable:

....
$ host -t SRV  _kerberos._udp.example.com
_kerberos._udp.example.com has SRV record 0 100 88 dc.example.com
....

The server running Cockpit should have a fully qualified name that ends
with the domain name.

There must be a valid Kerberos host key for the server in the
`/etc/krb5.keytab` file. Alternatively, if you would like to use a
different keytab, you can do so by placing it in
`/etc/cockpit/krb5.keytab`, or below `$XDG++_++CONFIG++_++DIRS` if set
(see link:./cockpit.conf.5.html[cockpit.conf]). It may be necessary to
create a kerberos service principal and update the keytab if it is not
present. Depending on your domain type different service names are
required:

Active Directory::
  `HOST/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM`
IPA and MIT::
  `HTTP/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM`

When joining an IPA domain with Cockpit and the `ipa` command line tool
is available, both the service principal name and a
`/etc/cockpit/krb5.keytab` get created automatically, so that Kerberos
based single sign on into Cockpit works out of the box. If you want/need
to do this by hand or in a script, first create or modify the `HTTP/`
service principal:

....
$ sudo ipa service-add --ok-as-delegate=true --ok-to-auth-as-delegate=true \
    HTTP/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
# or, if it already exists, just enable delegation:
$ sudo ipa service-mod --ok-as-delegate=true --ok-to-auth-as-delegate=true \
    HTTP/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
....

Then generate a key for that principal:

....
$ sudo ipa-getkeytab -p HTTP/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM -k /etc/cockpit/krb5.keytab
....

The following command can be used to list the
`/etc/cockpit/krb5.keytab`:

....
$ sudo klist -k /etc/cockpit/krb5.keytab
....

Lastly accounts from the domain must be resolvable to unix accounts on
the server running Cockpit. For example:

....
$ getent passwd user@example.com
user@example.com:*:381001109:381000513:User Name:/home/user:/bin/sh
....

If you wish to delegate your kerberos credentials to Cockpit, and allow
Cockpit to then connect to other machines using those credentials, you
should enable delegation for the hosts running Cockpit, and in some
cases the `HTTP` service as well. When joining an IPA domain, this is
enabled by default.

Domain admins (usually the `admins@example.com` group) should normally
also be able to administer any joined machine. Enable sudo access for
that group with the following command on the IPA server, for version
4.7.1 and later:

....
ipa-advise enable-admins-sudo | sh -ex
....

On earlier FreeIPA versions, run these commands instead, as a domain
admin on any joined machine:

....
ipa sudorule-add --hostcat=all --cmdcat=all All
ipa sudorule-add-user --groups=admins All
....

Note that this does not change security properties; domain admins can
give this privilege to themselves, so it is safe to enable by default.

[[sso-client]]
=== Client Requirements

The client side, where your web browser is running, should have a valid
kerberos ticket in the current user session. A command like this will
get one:

....
$ kinit user@EXAMPLE.COM
Password for user@EXAMPLE.COM:
....

In addition your browser must be usually be configured to allow kerberos
authentication for the domain.

Mozilla Firefox::
  Go to `about:config` and set the `network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris`
  setting to your domain name preceded by a dot, ie: `.example.com`
Google Chrome::
  On Linux: create the file
  `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/example-com.json` with the contents:
  +
....
{
  "AuthServerWhitelist": "*example.com"
}
....
  +
  and restart the browser. On other platforms, exit your browser
  completely, and start it with a command line like this:
  `google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist=++*++example.com`

Use a fully qualified server name (with the domain name at the end) to
access Cockpit in your web browser.

If you wish to connect from one server to another in Cockpit using
kerberos SSO, then you have to explicitly enable all sorts of things.
For starters, make sure that delegated credentials are allowed by your
domain (see above). Next when requesting your kerberos ticket make sure
that forwardable tickets are requested:

....
$ kinit -f user@EXAMPLE.COM
Password for user@EXAMPLE.COM:
....

Make sure that the forwardable flag `F` is present in your ticket:

....
$ klist -f
Ticket cache: KEYRING:persistent:1000:1000
Default principal: user@EXAMPLE.COM

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
18.03.2017 05:39:23  19.03.2017 05:39:20  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
    Flags: FIA
....

Lastly configure your browser to allow delegated, forwardable kerberos
credentials to be sent to Cockpit:

Mozilla Firefox::
  Go to `about:config` and set the
  `network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris` setting to your domain name
  preceded by a dot, ie: `.example.com`
Google Chrome::
  On Linux: create the file
  `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/example-com.json` with the contents:
  +
....
{
  "AuthServerWhitelist": "*example.com",
  "AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelist": "*example.com"
}
....
  +
  and restart the browser. On other platforms, exit your browser
  completely, and start it with a command line like this:
  `google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist=++*++example.com --auth-negotiate-delegate-whitelist=++*++example.com`
