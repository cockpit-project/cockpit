// FIXME: Remove this custom implementation once a component exists upstream.
// PF overrides to fake a multiselect widget (as one does not currently exist in PF4).
// A menu gives us the interaction we want, but the styling is a bit off.
// Therefore, we're changing the visuals here locally.
// PF4 upstream request for multi-select @ https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4027
