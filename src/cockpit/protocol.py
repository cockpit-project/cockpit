# All CockpitProtocol subclasses should derive from either
# CockpitProtocolClient or CockpitProtocolServer.  The main difference here is
# that the server should send its init message immediately upon the connection
# being established, whereas the client shouldn't do anything until it sees the
# init message from the server.  Additionally, the client needs to be able to
# respond to authorize challenges (via `do_authorize()`), whereas on the server
# side, we will never send those ourselves (and therefore not need to handle
# the responses).
#
# Both clients and servers need to implement `do_channel_control()` and
# `do_channel_data()` as well as `do_init()`.
