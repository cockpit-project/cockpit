cockpit.js: HTTP Client

HTTP and REST API communication

Cockpit allows access to local HTTP and REST services via this API.

[[cockpit-http-constructor]]
== cockpit.http()

....
http = cockpit.http(endpoint, [options])
http = cockpit.http(options)
....

Create a new HTTP client. The `endpoint` can be a file path starting
with `/` to connect to a unix socket, or it can be a port number to
connect to. The optional `options` argument is a javascript plain
object, and may include:

`"address"`::
  Connect to an address other than localhost. Must be a valid host name
  or IP address. To use this option you also must provide a port number.
`"port"`::
  Port number to use with "address" option, when not given in
  `endpoint`.
`"tls"`::
  Object properties for an https connection. See
  `http-stream2 TLS options`.
`"headers"`::
  Additional HTTP headers to include with the HTTP request. This is a
  plain javascript object with each key as a header name, and each value
  as the header value.
`"superuser"`::
  Set to `"require"` to open this channel as root. If the currently
  logged in user is not permitted to become root (eg: via `pkexec`) then
  the `channel` will immediately be
  link:#cockpit-channels-close-ev[closed] with a `"access-denied"`
  problem code.
  +
  Set to `"try"` to try to make the request as root, but if that fails,
  fall back to perform an unprivileged request.
`"tls"`::
  If set to a plain javascript object, then the connection will be an
  HTTPS connection and include TLS encryption. The fields of the `tls`
  object declare various TLS configuration and data. All fields are
  optional:
  +
  * `"authority"`: Certificate authority(s) to expect as signers of the
  server's TLS certificate, represented as a plain javascript object. It
  should have either a `"file"` field containing a readable PEM file on
  the system containing authorities, or a `"data"` with PEM encoded
  certificate data.
  * `"certificate"`: A client certificate to use, represented as a plain
  javascript object. It should have either a `"file"` field containing a
  readable PEM file on the system to use as a certificate, or a `"data"`
  with PEM encoded certificate data.
  * `"key"`: A client key to use, represented as a plain javascript
  object. It should have either a `"file"` field containing a readable
  PEM file on the system to use as a key, or a `"data"` with PEM encoded
  key data.
  * `"validate"`: A boolean that describes whether to validate the
  server's TLS certificate or not. By default local connections are not
  validated, and remote connections are validated.

Here is a somewhat complex example of using most of the above `options`
when when calling `cockpit.http()`:

....
http = cockpit.http({
    "address": "localhost",
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="
    },
    "port": 443,
    "tls": {
        "validate": true,
        "authority": {
            "file": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",
        },
        "certificate": {
            "data": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDsDCCA..."
        },
        "key": {
            "data": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEogIBA..."
        }
    }
});
....

[[cockpit-http-get]]
== http.get()

....
request = http.get(path, [params, [headers]])
....

Perform an HTTP GET request for the given `path`. If the `params` is
specified it should be a plain javascript object, which will be turned
into a query string.

Optionally a plain javascript object containing headers can be included
in the `headers` argument.

The return value is a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
that will complete if the request happens successfully, or fail if
there's a problem.

[[cockpit-http-post]]
== http.post()

....
request = http.post(path, body, [headers])
....

Perform an HTTP POST request for the given `path`. The `body` can be a
string, or a javascript plain object, which will be encoded as JSON
data. If `body` is `undefined` or `null` then an empty HTTP body will be
sent.

Optionally a plain javascript object containing headers can be included
in the `headers` argument.

The return value is a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
that will complete if the request happens successfully, or fail if
there's a problem.

[[cockpit-http-request]]
== http.request()

....
request = http.request(options)
....

Perform an HTTP request. The `options` can contain the following:

`"body"`::
  The HTTP request body. If you do not specify a body, then you must
  call link:#cockpit-http-input[request.input()] to complete the body
  and allow the request to start.
`"headers"`::
  A javascript plain object containing HTTP headers.
`"method"`::
  The HTTP method. Defaults to `"GET"`.
`"params"`::
  A javascript plain object containing query string parameters.
`"path"`::
  The HTTP path. Defaults to `/`.

The return value is a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
that will complete if the request happens successfully, or fail if
there's a problem.

[[cockpit-http-then]]
== request.then()

....
request.then(data => { ... })
....

This is a standard
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
method. It sets up a handler to be called when the request finishes
successfully.

The `data` argument contains the body result of the request. If it a
string, unless the process was opened in binary mode, in which case the
`data` is an array of bytes. If a `request.stream()` handler is set up,
then any standard output data consumed by the handler will not be
included in the `data` argument.

[[cockpit-http-catch]]
== request.catch()

....
request.catch((exception[, data]) => { ... })
....

This is a standard
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
method. It sets up a handler to be called when the request fails, or
returns an error code.

The `exception` object passed to the handler can have the following
fields:

`problem`::
  A link:#cockpit-problems[problem code] string when a problem occurred
  starting or communicating with the server. This is `null` if the
  process exited or was terminated.
`status`::
  The numeric status of the response. This is `null` if no response was
  received.
`reason`::
  A string reason returned in the response. This is `null` if no
  response was received.
`message`::
  A string message returned in the response. This is `null` if no
  response was received.

If the request returned a response body, it will be available in the
`data` argument. Otherwise this argument will be `undefined`.

[[cockpit-http-response]]
== request.response()

....
request.response((status, headers) => { ... })
....

This sets up a handler to be called when the HTTP request gets the
initial response from the server. The `status` argument is the HTTP
status integer, and the `headers` is a plain javascript object
containing the headers of the response.

[[cockpit-http-stream]]
== request.stream()

....
request.stream(data => { ... })
....

This sets up a handler to be called when the request returns output
data. The handler will be called multiple times.

Only one handler may be registered at a time. Registering an additional
handler replaces the previous one. The handler receives either string
`data` or an array of binary bytes as its argument. A stream handler may
return a number, which indicates the number of characters or bytes
consumed from `data`. Any data not consumed will be included again the
next time the handler is called.

If a `request.stream()` handler is set up, then the `request.then()`
handlers will only get any remaining data not consumed by the stream
handler.

[[cockpit-http-input]]
== request.input()

....
request.input(data, [stream])
....

This method writes `data` to the HTTP request body. It is only valid if
no `"body"` has been specified in
link:#cockpit-http-request[http.request()] options. If `stream` is
`true` then this function can be called again to provide further data.

[[cockpit-http-close]]
== request.close()

....
request.close([problem])
....

Cancel the request. If `problem` is specified it should be a standard
link:#cockpit-problems[problem code] string.

[[cockpit-http-close-all]]
== http.close()

....
http.close([problem])
    
....

Cancel all outstanding requests with the given problem code. This is
useful when you know that the server is going down soon.
