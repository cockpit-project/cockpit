== Loading Manifests

For a convenient access to all page manifests, include
`+<script src="../manifests.js"></script>+` into your page to register
the manifests at the `+cockpit.manifests+` global variable.

You can also load `+../manifests.json+` directly in your page, with
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch[`+fetch()+`].
