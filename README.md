# Cockpit, a remote manager for GNU/Linux servers

### About
Cockpit is a server manager that makes it easy to administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.

#### Easy to use
Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform simple tasks such as storage administration, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

#### No interference
Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.

#### Multi-server
You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add them with a single click and your machines will look after its buddies.

### Caveat
This is pre-release software.  Only install it in a system that
you are ready to lose.  It is a good idea to make a virtual
machine (or three) to play around with Cockpit.

Cockpit is not yet ready for actual use, that's why there aren't any
installation instructions.  But if you want to play with the code,
please see the `HACKING.md` file.
