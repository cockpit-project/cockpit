Cockpit with CIM
================

This connects to CIM locally and retrieves some information. We use Cockpit for
remoting so we get consistent user identity, authentication, firewall access, etc.


Install pegasus and make it run:
 $ sudo yum install tog-pegasus

Add yourself to the Pegasus group:
 $ sudo usermod -a -G pegasus $USER

Start Pegasus and make sure that it works:
 $ sudo systemctl start tog-pegasus
 $ sudo /usr/sbin/cimconfig -l

Link the package into your home directory.
 * Make sure Cockpit works on the local machine.
 $ cd /path/to/cockpit/examples/poc-cim
 $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/cockpit
 $ ln -snf $(pwd) ~/.local/share/cockpit/
 $ sudo systemctl restart cockpit

Go to http://localhost:9090/ and log into Cockpit using your web browser,
with the same account as you used as (ie: $USER) above.

Select "CIM Proof of Concept" from the "Tools" menu.
