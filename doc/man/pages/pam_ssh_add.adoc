pam++_++ssh++_++add

PAM module to auto load ssh keys into an agent

== DESCRIPTION

pam++_++ssh++_++add provides authentication and session modules that
allow users to start their session with a running ssh-agent with as many
ssh keys loaded as possible.

If used, the authentication module simply stores the authentication
token for later use by the session module. Because this module performs
no actual authentication it returns PAM++_++CRED++_++INSUFFICIENT on
success and should always be accompanied by an actual authentication
module in your pam configuration.

By default the session module will start a new ssh-agent and run
ssh-add, loading any keys that exist in the default path for the newly
logged in user. If any keys prompt for a password, and a authentication
token was successfully stored, that token will be provided as the
password.

== Options

`debug`::
  This option will turn on debug logging to syslog.
