== Loading Manifests

For a convenient access to all page manifests, include
`++<++script src="../manifests.js"++><++/script++>++` into your page to
register the manifests at the `cockpit.manifests` global variable.

You can also load `../manifests.json` directly in your page, with
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch[`fetch()`].
