Webpack build output
====================

This directory is populated with the built Cockpit packages (see HACKING.md).

You can link this directory into your home directory and have
Cockpit on your local machine use the built packages:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/
    $ ln -s $(pwd)/dist ~/.local/share/cockpit

Make sure to log into Cockpit as the same user on the same local
machine as you are running the commands above.
