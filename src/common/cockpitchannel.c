/**
 * CockpitChannel:
 *
 * A base class for channels. Derived classes implement the actual payload
 * contents, opening the channel etc...
 *
 * A CockpitChannel is the base class for C code where messages on
 * the internal protocol are translated to IO of another type, be
 * that HTTP, stdio, DBus, WebSocket, file access, or whatever. Another
 * similar analogue to this code is the javascript cockpit.channel code
 * in cockpit.js.
 *
 * Most uses of this code are in the bridges, but cockpit-ws also (rarely)
 * uses CockpitChannel to translate the frontend side of channels to HTTP
 * or WebSocket responses.
 *
 * The channel queues messages received until unfrozen. The caller can
 * start off a channel as frozen, and then the implementation later
 * indicates that it's open and ready to receive messages.
 *
 * A channel sends messages over a #CockpitTransport. If the transport
 * closes then the channel closes, but the channel can also close
 * individually either for failure reasons, or with an orderly shutdown.
 *
 * See doc/protocol.md for information about channels.
