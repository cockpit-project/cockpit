# Cockpit
**A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers**

[cockpit-project.org](http://cockpit-project.org/)

Cockpit is an interactive server admin interface. It is easy to use and very light weight.
Cockpit interacts directly with the operating system from a real Linux session in a browser.

### Using Cockpit

You can [install Cockpit](http://cockpit-project.org/running.html) on many Linux operating
systems including Debian, Fedora and RHEL.

Cockpit makes Linux discoverable, allowing sysadmins to easily perform tasks such as starting
containers, storage administration, network configuration, inspecting logs and so on.

Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit
can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen
in the Cockpit journal interface.

On the Cockpit dashboard, you can easily add other machines with Cockpit installed that are
accessible via SSH.
