Cockpit with VNC
================

This connects to VNC locally using noVNC http://kanaka.github.io/noVNC/
We use Cockpit for WebSocket, remoting, user identity, authentication,
file access, encryption etc.

Use virt-manager to configure a VM for VNC on a given port. Or expose
a VNC port another way. Do this on the same machine that you're running
Cockpit.

Link the package into your home directory.
 * Make sure Cockpit works on the local machine.
 $ cd /path/to/cockpit/examples/poc-vnc
 $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/cockpit
 $ ln -snf $(pwd) ~/.local/share/cockpit/
 $ sudo systemctl restart cockpit

Go to http://localhost:9090/ and log into Cockpit using your web browser,
with the same account as you used as (ie: $USER) above.

Select "VNC Proof of Concept" from the "Tools" menu.
