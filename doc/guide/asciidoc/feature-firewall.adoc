== Firewall

Cockpit uses https://www.firewalld.org[firewalld] to interact with the
system's firewall. No firewall configuration UI will be shown if
firewalld is not installed.

Firewalld controls access to its APIs via PolicyKit. The user logged
into Cockpit needs to have the appropriate permissions to view or modify
the settings.

Cockpit can currently only show, add, and remove predefined firewalld
services in the default zone.

To perform similar tasks from the command line, use
https://www.firewalld.org/documentation/man-pages/firewall-cmd.html[firewall-cmd].
For example, to get the same list of allowed services that Cockpit
displays:

....
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
dhcpv6-client samba-client mdns ssh cockpit
....

To enable an additional service, use:

....
$ firewall-cmd --add-service pop3
success
....
