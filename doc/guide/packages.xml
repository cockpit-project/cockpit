  <title>Cockpit Packages</title>

  <para>Cockpit is separated into various packages, each of which brings specific
    features and/or code.</para>

  <warning>
    <para>It is not yet possible to implement arbitrary new packages.</para>

    <para>In addition, any APIs or behavior not explicitly documented here is an
      internal API and can be changed at any time.</para>
  </warning>

  <section id="package-layout">
    <title>Layout of Package Files</title>

    <para>A package consists of one or more files placed in a directory or its
      subdirectories. It must have a <code>manifest.json</code> file and follow
      certain naming conventions.</para>

    <para>The name of a package is the name of the directory.</para>

    <para>Cockpit uses the data directories from the
      <ulink url="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory
        Specification</ulink>
      to locate packages. The <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> represents a colon separate list of system data
      directories, and <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> is a user specific data directory. If the environment
      variables are not set, defaults are used, according to the spec.</para>

    <para>A <code>cockpit/</code> subdirectories in any of these data directories is the location where
      packages are loaded by Cockpit. If Cockpit finds a package with the same name, in multiple data
      directories, then the first one wins. According to the spec the first data directory is
      <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> and then <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> in order.</para>

    <para>This means that, by default the following directories are searched for cockpit packages, and
      in this order:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><code>~/.local/share/cockpit/</code></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><code>/usr/local/share/cockpit/</code></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><code>/usr/share/cockpit/</code></para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Packages placed in <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> are not cached by Cockpit or the web browser.
      Other packages are cached agressively, and are accessed using a checksum of the files in
      the packages and their names.</para>

    <para>To further clarify things, here is an example package called "my-package" and its file layout:</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/share/cockpit/
    my-package/
        manifest.json
        file.html
        some.js
</programlisting>

    <para>Place or symlink packages in your <code>~/.local/share/cockpit</code> directory (or appropriate
      <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> location) that you would like to modify and develop. System installed
      packages should not change while Cockpit is running.</para>

  <section id="package-manifest">
    <title>Package Manifest</title>

    <para>Each package has a <code>manifest.json</code> file. It is a JSON object. The following
      fields may be present in the manifest:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>version</term>
        <listitem><para>An informational version number for the package.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
