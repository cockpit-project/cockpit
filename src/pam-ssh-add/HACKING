Working on pam_ssh_add.so
-------------------------

For now this is part of Cockpit, but may eventually be split out. So only
basic glibc and linux dependencies are allowed:

 * glibc
 * pam

Tests
-----
Right now the bulk of the code is unit tested using mock versions of ssh-add
and ssh-agent. However the pam module itself is only tested with integration
tests. Hopefully the cwrap project will get the ability to mock pam. When that
happens we should add unit tests for the actual pam module as well.
