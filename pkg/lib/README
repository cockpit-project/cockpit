# Cockpit Javascript Runtime Dependencies

Cockpit uses various javascript dependencies at runtime in the browser
such as jQuery, or components that we're building and incubating here.

External dependencies are retrieved via Bower and live in subdirectories
of the lib/ directory. The components being incubated live in the top
level of the lib/ directory.

The repository is undergoing a migration to webpack and other bundling
tooling. Once this is the case, we won't commit NPM components into
git. But until then the files and LICENSES that we bundle, are committed
to git.
