# This is a script run to release Cockpit
#
# This script is run in a cockpit/release container:
# https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpituous/tree/main/release
#
# This gets triggered on pushing a signed release tag, through a GitHub action:
#
#   .github/workflows/release.yml
#
# Anything that start with 'job' may run in a way that it SIGSTOP's
# itself when preliminary preparition and then gets a SIGCONT in
# order to complete its work

# Initial variables which help the scripts share
RELEASE_SPEC=tools/cockpit.spec
RELEASE_CONTROL=tools/debian/control
RELEASE_SRPM=$PWD/_release/srpm
RELEASE_DSC=$PWD/_release/dsc
RELEASE_SOURCE=$PWD/_release/source

# Build the source tarball patches and srpm
job release-source
job release-srpm

# Upload release to github, using tarball
job release-github

# Update the Github repo that Docker Hub is tracking
# FIXME: this broke with releasing to COPR via packit, needs to be triggered
# manually for now and automated as a separate workflow
# job release-dockerhub cockpit-project/cockpit-container

# Upload documentation
