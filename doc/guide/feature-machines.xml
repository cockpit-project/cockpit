  <title>Multiple Machines</title>

  <para>Cockpit can connect to multiple machines from a single Cockpit session.
    These are listed on the <emphasis>Machines</emphasis> dashboard.</para>

  <para>These additional machines are accessed via SSH from the machine that
    the first machine connected to, and are
    <link linkend="authentication">authenticated</link> with the logged in
    user's password and/or SSH keys.</para>

  <para>Using SSH keys is only supported when the system has the
    necessary APIs in libssh.</para>

  <para>There is currently no command line interface for adding and/or removing
    machines from the dashboard. The machine data is stored in
    <filename>/var/lib/cockpit/machines.json</filename> and SSH host keys are
    stored in <filename>/var/lib/cockpit/known_hosts</filename>.</para>
