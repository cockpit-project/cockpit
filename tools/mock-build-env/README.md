These are some stub pkg-config and include files that allow us to run
`make dist` in a restricted build environment without the regular build
dependencies, in particular [Packit](https://packit.dev/)'s [sandcastle container](https://github.com/packit/sandcastle).

These are used in [packit.yaml](./packit.yaml).
