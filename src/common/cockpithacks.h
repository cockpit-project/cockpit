/* Here's where we try to implement "temporary" workaround code:
 * anything that might be labelled TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, etc.  Having
 * the workarounds in one place gives at least two advantages:
 *
 *   - common workarounds made in several places can be given a single
 *     function/macro/etc. defined in this file, giving a common place
 *     to document the workaround, links to related bug reports, etc.
 *     This also makes removing the workaround easier: remove it from
 *     this file and the compiler will help us find all the places where
 *     we were using it.
 *
 *     For this reason, we even add small functions here for totally
 *     trivial stuff.
 *
 *   - having all of our hacks in a central place gives us one place to
 *     periodically check, allowing us to remove hacks that are not
 *     longer relevant (because the bug got fixed, etc).
 *
 * This file is intended to be included from code which isn't using
 * GLib, and therefore must only contain "pure libc" C.  For code that
 * depends on GLib (and friends), there's cockpithacks-glib.h.
