Comment:
 This does not directly cover the files in dist/*. These are "minified" and
 compressed JavaScript/HTML files built from pkg/* and node_modules/* with
 node, npm, and webpack. Their copyrights and licenses are described below.
 Rebuilding these requires internet access as that process needs to download
 additional npm modules from the Internet, thus upstream ships the pre-minified
 webpacks as part of the upstream release tarball so that the package can be
 built without internet access and lots of extra unpackaged build dependencies.
