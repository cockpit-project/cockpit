== Name

cockpit - Cockpit

== Description

Cockpit is a web accessible interactive admin interface for Linux
machines. Cockpit can usually be accessed on port `9090` of the
machine it's installed on. Cockpit starts on demand. Use your system
credentials to log in.

== Components

The *cockpit-ws* web service listens on port `9090` and is started
on demand by *systemd*. The Cockpit web service authenticates the
user, loads Cockpit into the browser, and starts *cockpit-bridge* in a
Linux user session.

The *cockpit-bridge* provides Cockpit in the web browser with access
to the system APIs. It does this over its standard in and standard out.
The bridge is started like a shell once per Linux user session.
