[[listen]]
= TCP Port and Address

Cockpit's `+cockpit-ws+` component is configured by default to accept
connections on port `+9090+`. This is the port that is documented for a
"Web-based System Manager" to listen on. It is also relatively
memorable.

However there are many reasons you may wish to change the default port.
For example other software may use port `+9090+` or you may wish to
setup Cockpit to listen on `+443+` instead. It is also possible to have
Cockpit only listen on one specific IP address.

Note that it is only required to have Cockpit listening on a TCP port on
the server that you access with your web browser. If you add multiple
servers with host switcher, Cockpit will connect to those servers via
`+ssh+`.

The systems that Cockpit runs on are typically locked down with
firewalls, SELinux, so changing the default port is not as easy as
editing a configuration file.

[[listen-systemd]]
== Cockpit systemd Socket

On servers with
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/[`+systemd+`] Cockpit
starts on demand via socket activation. To change its port and/or
address you should place the following content in the
`+/etc/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.d/listen.conf+` file. Create the
file and directories in that path which not already exist. The
`+ListenStream+` option specifies the desired address and TCP port.

....
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenStream=443
....

....
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenStream=7777
ListenStream=192.168.1.1:443
FreeBind=yes
....

NOTE: The first line with an empty value is intentional. `+systemd+`
allows multiple `+Listen+` directives to be declared in a single socket
unit; an empty value in a drop-in file resets the list and thus disables
the default port 9090 from the original unit.

The `+FreeBind+` option is highly recommended when defining specific IP
addresses. See the
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html[`+systemd.socket+`
manpage] for details.

In order for the changes to take effect, run the following commands:

....
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart cockpit.socket
....

[[listen-selinux]]
== SELinux Port

If https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page[SELinux] is protecting your
server, then you will need to tell it to allow Cockpit to listen on the
new port. Run the following command to do so. The last argument
specifies the desired TCP port.

....
$ sudo semanage port -a -t websm_port_t -p tcp 9999
....

If the port is already defined by some other part of the SELinux policy,
then you will need to use the `+-m+` argument to modify the definition.
That's the case with the `+443+` SSL port, which is typically defined as
an `+http_port_t+` port.

....
$ sudo semanage port -m -t websm_port_t -p tcp 443
....

The changes should take effect immediately.

[[listen-firewalld]]
== Firewalld Port

If https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FirewallD[Firewalld] is configured as
your firewall, then you will need to tell it to allow Cockpit to receive
connections on the new port. Run the following commands to do so. The
last options specify the desired TCP port.

....
$ sudo firewall-cmd [--zone=ZONE] --add-port=443/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent [--zone=ZONE] --add-port=443/tcp
....
