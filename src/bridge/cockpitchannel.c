/**
 * CockpitChannel:
 *
 * A base class for the server (ie: bridge) side of a channel. Derived
 * classes implement the actual payload contents, opening the channel
 * etc...
 *
 * The channel queues messages received until the implementation
 * indicates that it's open and ready to receive messages.
 *
 * A channel sends messages over a #CockpitTransport. If the transport
 * closes then the channel closes, but the channel can also close
 * individually either for failure reasons, or with an orderly shutdown.
 *
 * See doc/protocol.md for information about channels.
