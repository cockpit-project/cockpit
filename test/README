# Automated Testing of Cockpit

This directory contains automated tests for Cockpit, and the support
files for them.

To run the tests, you need to install the following packages on
Fedora:

  # yum install trickle nbd-server js npm python-libguestfs
  # npm install phantomjs

## Quick list of tools

vm-create,   for creating bare test machine images.
vm-install,  for installing RPMs into a test machine image.
vm-run,      for running a test machine image.
vm-copy,     for copying files into a running test machine.
vm-sh,       for executing commands in a running test machine.

## Test machines

The code under test is executed in a dedicated virtual machine, called
the "test machine".  This test machine is started for each test and
should already contain the version of Cockpit that should be tested.

The test machine is created with the "vm-create" program in this
directory, and new versions of Cockpit can be installed into it with
"vm-install".  You can manually run it with "vm-run" if you like, but
that is usually done automatically by the tests.

The modifications done to the test machine by a test are only
temporary and are gone when the test machine is started for the next
test.

Thus, you only need to create the test machine once, or when you
manage to break it beyond repair while maintaining it.

Typical steps to create a test machine:

  $ ./vm-create
  $ ./vm-install ./cockpit-wip-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm cockpit-test-assets-wip-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm

## Running tests

You can run tests by picking a program and just executing it:

  $ ./check-realms

This will use the test machine created above.

## Debugging tests

If you pass the "-s" ("sit on failure") option to a test program, it
will pause when a failure occurs so that you can log into the test
machine and investigate the problem.

You can log into a running test-machine with "vm-sh".

You can also put calls to sit() into the tests themselves to stop them
at strategic places.

You can use the "--vm-start-hook" option to execute an arbitrary shell
command after a test machine has been booted but before the test
begins.

That way, you can run a test cleanly while still being able to make
quick changes, such as adding debugging output to JavaScript.

The environment variable TEST_MACHINE is set to the identifier of the
machine that has just been booted.

For example, one might run a full "make install DESTDIR=..." and copy
the resulting installation directory to the test machine.  This can
maybe be done by a script like this:

    inst=/var/tmp/INST
    f18 rm -rf "$inst"
    f18 make-top -k install DESTDIR="$inst"
    f18 tar -C "$inst" -cf - . | ./vm-sh --machine $TEST_MACHINE 'cd / && cpio -idu'

The "f18" command executes a command on the build machine.

## Guidelines for writing tests

It is OK for a test to destroy the test machine OS installation, or
otherwise modify it without cleaning up.  For example, it is OK to
remove all of /etc just to see what happens.  The next test will get a
pristine test machine.

A fast running test suite is more important than independent,
small test cases.

Thus, it is OK for tests to be long.  Starting the test machine is so
slow that we should run as many checks within a single session as make
sense.

Still, within a long test, try to have independent sections, where
each section returns the machine to more or less the state that it was
in before the section.  This makes it easier to run these sections
ad-hoc when doing incremental development.
