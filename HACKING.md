# Hacking on Cockpit

Here's where to get the code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit
    $ cd cockpit/

The remainder of the commands assume you're in the top level of the
Cockpit git repository checkout.

## Getting the development dependencies

Cockpit uses Node.js during development. Node.js is not used at runtime.
To make changes on Cockpit you'll want to install Node.js.

On Debian and recent Ubuntu â‰¥ 19.04:

    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs

On Fedora:

    $ sudo dnf install nodejs

On older OS releases you can use the [n utility](https://github.com/tj/n) to
get a current version of nodejs.

When relying on CI to run the test suite, this is all that is necessary to work
on the JavaScript components of Cockpit.

To build the Cockpit binaries from source, required to run the integration tests
locally (see [testing README](test/README.md)), you will need additional header
files and other components. The following should work in a fresh Git clone:

    $ sudo dnf install dnf-utils python-srpm-macros
    $ TEMPFILE=$(mktemp -u --suffix=.spec) && \
      sed 's/%{npm-version:.*}/0/' tools/cockpit.spec >$TEMPFILE && \
      sudo dnf builddep --spec $TEMPFILE && \
      rm $TEMPFILE

Note that `tools/cockpit.spec` is a template filled in by
`tools/gen-spec-dependencies` when building RPMs, and cannot be directly parsed
by dnf.

For running the browser unit tests, the following dependencies are required:

    $ sudo dnf install chromium-headless dbus-daemon

For running integration tests, the following dependencies are required:

    $ sudo dnf install curl expect xz rpm-build chromium-headless \
        libvirt-daemon-kvm libvirt-client python3-libvirt python3-pyflakes \
        python3-pycodestyle python3-pyyaml

Creating VM images locally (not necessary for running tests) needs the
following:

    $ sudo dnf install virt-install

Updating the `node_modules` (in case you need to modify `package.json`)
requires npm to be installed.

    $ sudo dnf install npm

## Building

Cockpit uses the autotools and thus there are the familiar `./configure`
script and Makefile targets.

After a fresh clone of the Cockpit sources, you need to prepare them by running
`autogen.sh` like this:

    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-debug

As shown, `autogen.sh` runs 'configure' with the given options, and it also
prepares the build tree by downloading various nodejs dependencies.

When working with a Git clone, it is therefore best to simply always
run `./autogen.sh` instead of `./configure`.

Then run

    $ make

to build everything. Cockpit has a single non-recursive Makefile. You can only
run `make` from the top-level and it will always rebuild the whole project.

You can run unit tests of the current checkout:

    $ make check

These should finish very quickly and it is good practice to do it often.

For debugging individual tests, there are compiled binaries in the build
directory. For QUnit tests (JavaScript), you can run

    $ ./test-server

which will output a URL to connect to with a browser, such as
`http://localhost:8765/dist/base1/test-dbus.html`. Adjust the path for different
tests and inspect the results there.

You can also run individual tests by specifying the `TESTS` environment
variable:

    $ make check TESTS=dist/base1/test-chan.html

There are also static code and syntax checks which you should run often:

    $ tools/test-static-code

It is highly recommended to set this up as a git pre-push hook, to avoid pushing
PRs that will fail on trivial errors:

    $ ln -s ../../tools/test-static-code .git/hooks/pre-push

## Running the integration test suite

Refer to the [testing README](test/README.md) for details on running the Cockpit
integration tests locally.

## Running eslint

Cockpit uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically check JavaScript
code style in `.js` and `.jsx` files.

The linter is executed within every build as a webpack preloader.

For developer convenience, the ESLint can be started explicitly by:

    $ npm run eslint

Violations of some rules can be fixed automatically by:

    $ npm run eslint:fix

Rules configuration can be found in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

During fast iterative development, you can also choose to not run eslint. This
speeds up the build and avoids build failures due to e. g.  ill-formatted
comments or unused identifiers:

    $ make ESLINT=0

## Working on your local machine: Cockpit's session pages

It's easy to set up your local Linux machine for rapid development of Cockpit's
JavaScript code (in pkg/). First install Cockpit on your local machine as
described in:

https://cockpit-project.org/running.html

Next run this command from your top level Cockpit checkout directory, and make
sure to run it as the same user that you'll use to log into Cockpit below.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/
    $ ln -s $(pwd)/dist ~/.local/share/cockpit

This will cause cockpit to read JavaScript and HTML files directly from the
built package output directory instead of using the installed Cockpit UI files.

Now you can log into Cockpit on your local Linux machine at the following
address. Use the same user and password that you used to log into your Linux
desktop.

http://localhost:9090

After every change to your sources the webpacks need to be rebuilt: You can just
run `make` to update everything that has changed; for iterating faster, you can
run webpack in "watch" mode on the particular page that you are working on,
which reduces the build time to less than a third. E. g.

    $ tools/webpack-watch systemd

Note that this disables eslint by default -- if you want to enable it, run it
as

    $ ESLINT=1 tools/webpack-watch systemd

Then reload cockpit in your browser after building the page.

To make Cockpit again use the installed code, rather than that from your git
checkout directory, run the following, and log into Cockpit again:

    $ rm ~/.local/share/cockpit

## Working on your local machine: Web server

To test changes to the login page or any other resources, you can bind-mount the
build tree's `dist/static/` directory over the  system one:

    $ sudo mount -o bind dist/static/ /usr/share/cockpit/static/

Likewise, to test changes to the branding, use

    $ sudo mount -o bind src/branding/ /usr/share/cockpit/branding/

After that, run `systemctl stop cockpit.service` to ensure that the web server
restarts on the next browser request.

To make Cockpit again use the system-installed code, simply umount these again:

    $ sudo umount /usr/share/cockpit/static/ /usr/share/cockpit/branding/
    $ systemctl stop cockpit.service

Similarly, if you change cockpit-ws itself, you can make the system (systemd
units, cockpit-tls, etc.) use that:

    $ sudo mount -o bind cockpit-ws /usr/libexec/cockpit-ws

On Debian based OSes, the path will be `/usr/lib/cockpit/cockpit-ws` instead.
You need to disable SELinux with

    $ sudo setenforce 0

for this to work, as your local build tree does not otherwise have the expected
SELinux type.

## Installation from upstream sources

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This will install Cockpit and all support files. If you have a
Fedora/RHEL/CentOS based distribution, install a PAM configuration with

    $ sudo cp tools/cockpit.pam /etc/pam.d/cockpit

If you have a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution, install this PAM config instead:

    $ sudo cp tools/cockpit.debian.pam /etc/pam.d/cockpit

For other distributions you need to create a PAM config yourself.

If you prefer to install to a different `--prefix` and would prefer
that `make install` not write outside that prefix, then specify the
`--enable-prefix-only` option to `autogen.sh`. This will result in an
installation of Cockpit that does not work without further tweaking.
For advanced users only.

## Build distribution packages

Instead of a direct `make install` as above, you can also build distribution
packages and install them. This is generally more robust, as they upgrade and
remove cleanly, and don't interfere with distribution packages in `/usr`.

In a Fedora/RHEL build environment you can build binary RPMs with

    tools/make-rpms --quick

In a Debian/Ubuntu build environment you can build debs with

    tools/make-debs --quick

## Updating `node_modules`

During a normal build from a git checkout, the `node_modules` will be
automatically unpacked from a cache kept in a separate git repository.  You can
force the unpack to occur using the `tools/node-modules checkout` command, but
this shouldn't be necessary.  In the event that you need to modify
`package.json` (to install a new module, for example) then you'll need to run
`tools/node-modules rebuild` to create a new cache from the result of running
`npm install` on your new `package.json`.

Your locally rebuilt changes to `node_modules` won't be used by others.  A new
version will be created by a github workflow when you open your pull request.

The `tools/node-modules` script inspects the `GITHUB_BASE` environment variable
to determine the correct repository to use when fetching and pushing.  It will
strip the repository name (leaving the project- or username) and use the
`node-cache.git` repository in that namespace.  If `GITHUB_BASE` is unset, it
will default to `cockpit-project/node-cache.git`.

A local cache is maintained in `~/.cache/cockpit-dev`.

## Contributing a change

Make a pull request on github.com with your change. All changes get reviewed,
tested and iterated on before getting into Cockpit. The general workflow is
described in the [wiki](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/wiki/Workflow).
Don't feel bad if there's multiple steps back and forth asking for changes or
tweaks before your change gets in.

You need to be familiar with git to contribute a change. Do your changes
on a branch. Your change should be one or more git commits that each contain one
single logical simple reviewable change, without modifications that are
unrelated to the commit message.

Cockpit is a designed project. Anything that the user will see should have
design done first. This is done on the wiki and mailing list.

Bigger changes need to be discussed on #cockpit or our mailing list
cockpit-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org before you invest too much time and
energy.

Feature changes should have a video and/or screenshots that show the change.
This video should be uploaded to Youtube or another service that allows video
embedding. Use a command like this to record a video including the browser
frame:

    $ recordmydesktop -x 1 -y 200 --width 1024 --height 576 \
        --fps 24 --freq 44100 --v_bitrate 2000000

You can also resize your browser window and move it to the right location with
a script. In Firefox you can open the Scratchpad (`Shift+F4`) and enter the
following commands:

    $ window.resizeTo(1024, 576);
    $ window.moveTo(1, 200);

Then run it with `Ctrl+R` when the browser is showing an empty tab, e.g.
`about:newtab`. You may need to adjust the positions for your environment.

## Debug logging of Cockpit processes

All messages from the various cockpit processes go to the journal and can be
seen with commands like:

    $ sudo journalctl -f

Much of Cockpit has more verbose internal debug logging that can be enabled when
trying to track down a problem. To turn it on add a file to your system like
this:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/cockpit.service.d
    $ sudo sh -c 'printf "[Service]\nEnvironment=G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=cockpit-ws,cockpit-bridge\nUser=root\nGroup=\n" > /etc/systemd/system/cockpit.service.d/debug.conf'
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl restart cockpit

In the above command you'll notice the string "cockpit-ws". This is a log
domain. There are various log domains you can enable:

 * cockpit-bridge: Cockpit bridge detailed debug messages
 * cockpit-protocol: Very verbose low level traffic logging
 * cockpit-ws: Cockpit Web Service detailed debug messages
 * WebSocket: Verbose low level WebSocket logging

To revert the above logging changes:

    $ sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/cockpit.service.d/debug.conf
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl restart cockpit

## Debug logging in Javascript console

Various javascript methods in Cockpit can show debug messages. You can turn them
on by setting a `window.debugging` global, or setting up a `debugging` property
in the browser storage. To do this run the following in your javascript console:

    >> sessionStorage.debugging = "all"

You'll notice that there's a ton of messages that get shown. If you
want to be more specific, instead of "all" use one of the following
specific types:

    "all"      // All available debug messages
    "channel"  // All channel messages sent to server
    "dbus"     // DBus related debug messages
    "http"     // HTTP (via the server) related debug messages
    "spawn"    // Debug messages related to executing processes

There are other strings related to the code you may be working on.

In addition, if you want your debug setting to survive a browser refresh or
Cockpit log out, use something like:

    >> localStorage.debugging = "spawn"

## Running Cockpit processes under a debugger

You may want to run cockpit-ws under a debugger such as valgrind or gdb. You can
run these processes as your own user, although you won't be able to debug all
the authentication logic in those cases.

First of all make sure Cockpit is installed correctly. Even though we will be
running cockpit-ws from the built sources this still relies on some of the right
bits being installed in order for Cockpit to work (ie: PAM stack, UI files,
cockpit-bridge, etc.)

This is how you would run cockpit-ws under gdb:

    $ export G_DEBUG=fatal-criticals
    $ export G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=cockpit-ws,cockpit-wrapper,cockpit-bridge
    $ gdb --args ./cockpit-ws --port 10000 --no-tls

And you can run cockpit-ws and cockpit-bridge under valgrind like this:

    $ export G_DEBUG=fatal-criticals
    $ export G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=cockpit-ws,cockpit-wrapper,cockpit-bridge
    $ valgrind --trace-children=yes --trace-children-skip='*unix_chkpwd*' \
          ./cockpit-ws --port 10000 --no-tls

Note that cockpit-session and cockpit-bridge will run from the installed
prefix, rather than your build tree.

# Running Microsoft Edge to test Cockpit

While running Firefox or Chrome on your Linux or Mac development machine may be
easy, some people find it harder to test Edge. To use the following method you
need access to the ```windows-10``` testin image. This image cannot be freely
distributed for licensing reasons.

Make sure you have the ```virt-viewer``` package installed on your Linux
machine. And then run the following from the Cockpit checkout directory:

    $ bots/vm-run windows-10

If the image is not yet downloaded, it'll take a while to download and you'll
see progress on the command line. A screen will pop up and Windows will boot.
Various command lines will show up once Windows has started. Ignore or minimize
them, before starting Edge.

Type the following into Edge's address bar to access Cockpit running on your
development machine:

     https://10.0.2.2:9090
