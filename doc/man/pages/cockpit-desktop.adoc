[[cockpit-desktop-description]]
== DESCRIPTION

The `cockpit-desktop` program provides secure access to Cockpit pages in
an already running desktop session. It starts a web server
(`cockpit-ws`) and a web browser in an isolated network namespace, and a
`cockpit-bridge(8)` in the running user session.

This avoids having to log into Cockpit, and having to enable
`cockpit.socket` system-wide. The network isolation ensures that no
other user, and not even other processes in the user's session, can
access this local web server.

`URLPATH` is the Cockpit page to open, i. e. the path component of
Cockpit URLs. It is highly recommended to only open a
https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html[particular page
frame], not the entire Cockpit navigation and menu. For example, the
path `/cockpit/@localhost/storage/index.html` will open the Storage
page. It is also possible to give abbreviated forms of urls, such as
"`storage`" or "`network/firewall`".

`SSH++_++HOST` is an optional SSH remote host specification (`hostname`
or `username@hostname`). If given, `cockpit-bridge` will be started on
the remote host through `ssh(1)` instead, i. e. the Cockpit web browser
will show that remote host. Note that this is more of an
experimental/demo feature.

[[cockpit-desktop-environment]]
== ENVIRONMENT

The `BROWSER` environment variable specifies the browser command (and
possibly options) that will be used to open the requested Cockpit page.
If not set, `cockpit-desktop` attempts to use an internal minimalistic
WebKit browser, and failing that, will attempt to detect some reasonable
alternatives.
