# Run a local bridge, web server, and browser for a particular Cockpit page.
# This is useful for integration into .desktop files, for systems which don't
# have cockpit.socket enabled. The web server and browser run in an unshared
# network namespace, and thus are totally isolated from everything else.
#
# Examples:
#   cockpit-desktop /cockpit/@localhost/system/index.html
#   cockpit-desktop network/firewall
#   cockpit-desktop users
#
# As an experimental/demo feature, the bridge can also be started on a remote
# ssh host. The host name is given as (optional) second argument, which is
# passed verbatim to ssh.
#
# Example:
#   cockpit-desktop system svr1
#   cockpit-desktop / username@svr1
