This is a Cockpit component that brings up system log viewer, with
filtering capabilities. On systemd based systems this displays the
entries from journal.

Component URL::
  `+/cockpit+app/@localhost/system/logs.html+`
Filter by priority::
  `+#?prio=notice+` +
   +
  Filters the log to show entries below the specific priority,
  inclusive. These
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_levels[priorities are
  syslog level keywords]. Specifying `+*+` as a priority will show all
  available entries. The default priority is `+err+`.
Filter by service::
  `+#?service=sshd.service+` +
   +
  Filters the log to show entries related to the specific service. The
  format of the service is specific to the logging implementation. For
  journald these are systemd service unit names.
Filter by tag::
  `+#?tag=kernel+` +
   +
  Filters the log to show entries related to the specific syslog
  identifier.
Filter by message::
  `+#?grep=+` +
   +
  Filters the log to show entries where the `+MESSAGE=+` field matches
  the specified regular expression. PERL-compatible regular expressions
  are used. If the pattern is all lowercase, matching is case
  insensitive. Otherwise, matching is case sensitive.
Filter by any field::
  `+#?FIELD=VALUE+` +
   +
  A field is referring to the components of a structured journal entry.
  The match must be exact. Value can be comma separated list in which
  case they are automatically matched as alternatives.
Start at point::
  `+#?start=boot+` +
   +
  Filters the log to show entries after the specific point in time.
  Valid values are `+boot+` (since last boot), `+last-24h+` (last 24
  hours), `+last-week+` (last seven days) and `+previous-boot+`
  (previous boot).
Follow the journal::
  `+#?follow=true+` +
   +
  Keep listening on new entries. Valid values are `+true+` (follow) and
  `+false+` (do not follow).
Show log entry::
  `+#/6e272d82993c4e0d...+` +
   +
  To show a specific log entry, put the log entry cursor in a path after
  the hash above. Note that cursors are logging system specific, and
  journal cursors are subject to change.
