 *
 * This is useful to keep track of multiple-syscall IO operations with
 * one global timeout, in the presence of multiple read() or write()
 * calls, poll(), and the possibility of EINTR.
 *
 * On the first call (when @start is filled with zeros), @start is
 * initialised and @timeout_remaining will be set to the value of
 * @timeout_us.  On successive calls (which should usually have the same
 * value of @timeout_us), smaller values will be returned in line with
 * the passage of time, until there is no timeout remaining.
 *
 * Returns #true when there has been a non-negative value written into
 * @timeout_remaining, and returns #false when the timeout has expired.
