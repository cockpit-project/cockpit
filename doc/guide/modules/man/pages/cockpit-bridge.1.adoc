== Name

cockpit-bridge - Cockpit Host Bridge

== Synopsis

*cockpit-bridge* [*--help*] [*--packages*]

== Description

The *cockpit-bridge* program is used by Cockpit to relay messages and
commands from the Web front end to the server. Among other things it
relays DBus, and spawns processes on behalf of the Web user interface.

This program is not routinely run by users or administrators. It is in
the *$PATH* so that Cockpit can find it when connecting between hosts.
However there are some diagnostics available when running from the
command line.

== Options

*--help*::
  Show help options.
*--interact*=_boundary_::
  Interact with the raw cockpit1 protocol. Useful for debugging and
  testing. Specify a _boundary_ which should be on an empty line
  between messages.
*--packages*::
  List all available Cockpit packages and exit. Note this includes
  packages available to the user running this command.
*--version*::
  Show Cockpit version information.
