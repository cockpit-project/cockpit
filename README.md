# Cockpit
**A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers**

### About
Cockpit is an interactive server admin interface. It is easy to use and very light weight.

#### Easy to use
Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform simple tasks such as storage administration, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

#### No interference
Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.

#### Multi-server
You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add them with a single click and your machines will look after its buddies.

software. We recommend installing pre-release versions in a virtual machine.
