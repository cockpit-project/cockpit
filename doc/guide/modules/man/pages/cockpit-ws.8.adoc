== Name

cockpit-ws - Cockpit web service

== Synopsis

*cockpit-ws* [*--help*] [*--port* _PORT_] [*--address* _ADDRESS_] [*--no-tls*]
			 [*--for-tls-proxy*] [*--local-ssh*] [*--local-session* _BRIDGE_]

== Description

The *cockpit-ws* program is the web service component used for
communication between the browser application and various configuration
tools and services like *cockpit-bridge(1)*.

Users or administrators should never need to start this program as it
automatically started by *systemd(1)* on bootup, through
*cockpit-tls(8)*.

== Transport security

*cockpit-ws* is normally run behind the *cockpit-tls* TLS
terminating proxy, and only deals with unencrypted HTTP by itself. But
for backwards compatibility it can also handle TLS connections by itself
when being run directly. For details how to configure certificates,
please refer to the *cockpit-tls(8)* documentation.

== Timeout

When started via *systemd(1)* then *cockpit-ws* will exit after 90
seconds if nobody logs in, or after the last user is disconnected.

== Options

*--help*::
  Show help options.
*--port* _PORT_::
  Serve HTTP requests _PORT_ instead of port *9090*. Usually Cockpit is
  started on demand by *systemd* socket activation, and this option
  has no effect. Update the *ListenStream* directive
  *cockpit.socket* file in the usual *systemd* manner.
*--address* _ADDRESS_::
  Bind to address _ADDRESS_ instead of binding to all available
  addresses. Usually Cockpit is started on demand by *systemd* socket
  activation, and this option has no effect. In that case, update the
  *ListenStream* directive in the *cockpit.socket* file in the usual
  *systemd* manner.
*--no-tls*::
  Don't use TLS.
*--for-tls-proxy*::
  Tell *cockpit-ws* that it is running behind a local reverse proxy
  that does the TLS termination. Then Cockpit puts https:// URLs into
  the default *Content-Security-Policy*, and accepts only https://
  origins, instead of http: ones by default. However, if *Origins* is
  set in the *cockpit.conf(5)* configuration file, it will override
  this default.
*--local-ssh*::
  Normally *cockpit-ws* uses *cockpit-session* and PAM to
  authenticate the user and start a user session. With this option
  enabled, it will instead authenticate via SSH at *127.0.0.1* port
  *22*.
*--local-session* _BRIDGE_::
  Skip all authentication and *cockpit-session*, and launch the
  *cockpit-bridge* specified in _BRIDGE_ in the local session. If the
  _BRIDGE_ is specified as `+-+` then expect an already running bridge
  that is connected to stdin and stdout of this *cockpit-ws* process.
  This allows the web server to run as any unprivileged user in an
  already running session.
  +
  This mode implies *--no-tls*, thus you need to use http:// URLs with
  this.

  [WARNING]
  ====
  If you use this, you _have to isolate the opened TCP port_ somehow
  (for example in a network namespace), otherwise all other users (or
  even remote machines if the port is not just listening on localhost)
  can access the session!
  ====

== ENVIRONMENT

The *cockpit-ws* process will use the *XDG_CONFIG_DIRS* environment
variable from the
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG
basedir spec] to find its *cockpit.conf(5)* configuration file.

In addition the *XDG_DATA_DIRS* environment variable from the
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG
basedir spec] can be used to override the location to serve static files
from. These are the files that are served to a non-logged in user.
