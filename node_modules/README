# Cockpit Development Dependencies

For Javascript processing, minification, and other development tasks
Cockpit uses Node.js dependencies to process its code. The Node.JS code
are packaged in the node_modules/ directory when distributed.

Cockpit does not use Node.js or any npm packages code at runtime. Binary builds
of Cockpit do not contain these dependencies.

In addition when building straight from a tarball it is also not necessary to
have Node.js installed.
