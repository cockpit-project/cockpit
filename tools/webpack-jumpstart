# Download pre-built webpack for current git SHA from GitHub

# These are produced by .github/workflows/build-dist.yml for every PR and push.
# This is a lot faster than having to npm install and run webpack.

# Returns 0 when successful, 1 in case of an error, or 2 in case the cache
# entry couldn't be found (but might be available after waiting a bit longer).

# Here we find "base commit": the commit in our local tree which is equal to
# the HEAD of the PR at the time the jumpstart was built.  This might not be
# the commit that the jumpstart was actually built against (in case the PR
# wasn't fully-rebased and GitHub merged some commits from main) and it might
# also not be the current local HEAD (in case local changes were added after.
# --rebase and --partial help us deal with those situations.
#
# For example:
#
#                        o---L---l           (local tree at start)
#                       /
#              a---b---H                     (PR head)
#             /        |\
#            /       --M \---N               (GitHub PR merge commits)
#           /       /       /
#   ---o---o---o---m---o---n                 (origin/main)
#                   \
#                    a'--b'--H'--L'--l'      (rebased result)
#
# We might be run from H, M, N, L or l.
#
# Someone has proposed a PR with three commits ('a', 'b', and head 'H'),
# branched off of main, which had two additional commits (up to head 'm') at
# the time of the jumpstart build.  GitHub will have created merge commit 'M'
# for the jumpstart build, but it will be marked with the tag `sha-H` so that
# it's possible for us to find it.  The jumpstart bundle will have a note of
# commit `m` in the contained `merge-base` file so that we can reconstruct the
# tree state of `M` for ourselves.  That's the idea of `--rebase`: we will
# rebase, adding commits a', b', and H' on top of m.  Assuming merging and
# rebasing produced the same result (which it almost always does), the tree
# state of H' will be exactly the same as M.
#
# We might also be asked to run against the merge commit ('M') itself, or a new
# merge commit ('N') in case main received additional commits.  In either case,
# the best thing we can do in either case is to back up to the original head
# 'H' and rebase onto 'm' from there, as above.
#
# Finally, it might be that our local tree was originally based on the HEAD
# commit that was built for the jumpstart, but has additionally gained extra
# local commits (head 'L') and/or uncommitted changes ('l').  In this case, we
# need to search through our own history to find the latest commit for which a
# jumpstart was built (ie: 'H'), and then after applying that jumpstart, touch
# the files that were changed, in order to make sure everything is properly
# rebuilt.  That's --partial.
