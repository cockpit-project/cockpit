  <title>Cockpit Authentication</title>

  <para>Cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time.
    While you will need to connect to the primary server with a password
    or kerberos ticket, cockpit does support accessing secondary machines via
    public key based authentication.</para>

  <para>Once a user is successfully logged in, an ssh-agent is started.
    The following keys are then preloaded into the ssh-agent provided
    they are supported by your ssh version, present, with the correct
    permission, and either unencrypted or encrypted with the same
    password that was used to login.</para>

  <programlisting>
  ~/.ssh/identity
  ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ~/.ssh/id_dsa
  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
  </programlisting>

  <para>Cockpit will provide an interface for loading other keys into the agent
    that could not be automatically loaded.</para>

  <para>Note that when a user is authenticated in this way the authentication
    happens without a password, as such the standard cockpit reauthorization
    mechanisms do not work. The user will only be able to obtain additional
    priviledges if they do not require a password.</para>
