  <title>SSL/TLS Usage</title>

  <para>Cockpit usually requires that web browsers communicate with it using HTTPS,
    for security reasons.</para>

  <section id="https-required">
    <title>HTTPS Requirement</title>

    <para>Cockpit listens for both HTTP and HTTPS connections on the same port, by
      default 9090. If an HTTP connection is made, Cockpit will redirect that
      connection to HTTPS. There are some exceptions:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>If an HTTP connection comes from <code>127.0.0.0/8</code>, then
        Cockpit will allow communication without redirecting to HTTPS.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Certain URLs, like <code>/ping</code> are not required to use
        HTTPS.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section id="https-certificates">
    <title>Certificates</title>

    <para>Cockpit will load a certificate from the <code>/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d</code>
      directory. It will use the first file with a <code>.cert</code> extension in
      alphabetical order.</para>

    <para>If no certificate is found, a self-signed certificate is created.</para>
