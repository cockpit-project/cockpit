Cockpit

== DESCRIPTION

Cockpit is a web accessible interactive admin interface for Linux
machines. Cockpit can usually be accessed on port `9090` of the machine
it's installed on. Cockpit starts on demand. Use your system credentials
to log in.

== COMPONENTS

The `cockpit-ws` web service listens on port `9090` and is started on
demand by `systemd`. The Cockpit web service authenticates the user,
loads Cockpit into the browser, and starts `cockpit-bridge` in a Linux
user session.

The `cockpit-bridge` provides Cockpit in the web browser with access to
the system APIs. It does this over its standard in and standard out. The
bridge is started like a shell once per Linux user session.

== BUGS
