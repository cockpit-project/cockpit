== Journal

The systemd journal provides Cockpit with indexed log data. This log
data is found on the Journal page, as well as in various other places
when configuring services, storage, networking etc.

Cockpit accesses Journal data via the

command. Similar tasks can be performed at the command line:

....
$ sudo journalctl -f -u docker
