== Loading Manifests

You can load manifest info by loading the `./manifest.json` file in your
package. In addition there is a shortcut, by loading the
`../manifests.json` you can load all the manifests at once.

Lastly load the `../manifests.js` file to register the manifests at the
`cockpit.manifests` global variable.
