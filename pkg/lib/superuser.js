import cockpit from "cockpit";

/* import { superuser } from "superuser";
 *
 * The "superuser" object indicates whether or not the current page
 * can open superuser channels.
 *
 * - superuser.allowed
 *
 * This is true when the page can open superuser channels, and false
 * otherwise. This field might be "null" while the page or the Cockpit
 * session itself is still initializing.
 *
 * UI elements that trigger actions that need administrative access
 * should be hidden when the "allowed" field is false or null.  (If
 * those elements also show information, such as with checkboxes or
 * toggle buttons, disable them instead of hiding.)
 *
 * UI elements that alert the user that they don't have administrative
 * access should be shown when the "allowed" field is exactly false,
 * but not when it is null.
 *
 * - superuser.addEventListener("changed", () => ...)
 *
 * The event handler is called whenever superuser.allowed has changed.
 * A page should update its appearance according to superuser.allowed.
 *
 * - superuser.addEventListener("reconnect", () => ...)
 *
 * The event handler is called whenever channels should be re-opened
 * that use the "superuser" option.
 *
 * The difference between "reconnect" and "connect" is that the
 * "reconnect" signal does not trigger when superuser.allowed goes
 * from "null" to its first real value.  You don't need to re-open
 * channels in this case, and it happens on every page load, so this
 * is important to avoid.
 *
 * - superuser.reload_page_on_change()
 *
 * Calling this function instructs the "superuser" object to reload
 * the page whenever "superuser.allowed" changes. This is a (bad)
 * alternative to re-initializing the page and intended to be used
 * only to help with the transition.
 *
 * Even if you are using "superuser.reload_page_on_change" to avoid having
 * to re-initialize your page dynamically, you should still use the
 * "changed" event to update the page appearance since
 * "superuser.allowed" might still change a couple of times right
 * after page reload.
