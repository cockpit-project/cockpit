# Cockpit Javascript Dependencies

For included Javascript libraries, and build processes
Cockpit uses Node.js dependencies to process its code. The required Node.JS
javascript code is packaged in the node_modules/ directory when distributed.

Cockpit does not use Node.js or any npm packages code at runtime. In addition
when building straight from a tarball it is also not necessary to have Node.js
installed.
