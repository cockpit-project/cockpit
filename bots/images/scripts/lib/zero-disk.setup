# We don't want to delete the pbuilder caches since we need them
# during build.  Mock with --offline and dnf is happy without caches,
# but with yum it isn't, so we provide an option to also leave the
# mock caches in place.
#
# We also want to keep cracklib since otherwise password quality
# checks break on Debian.
