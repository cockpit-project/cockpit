// Utility functions

/* These clean up block device etc before they are used for something
   else.  Specifically:

   - Any entries in fstab and crpyttab that refer to it are removed.

   - If this device contains a partition table, then all contained
     partitions are cleaned up as well.

   - If this device is encrypted, then the corresponding cleartext
     device is cleaned up, and this device is locked so that it is no
     longer in use.

   - Snapshots of logical volumes are cleaned up.

   - Thin volumes belonging to a thin pool are cleaned up.

   - Logical volumes of a volume group are cleaned up.

   - Systemd is reloaded so that it re-syncs itself with the modified
     fstab and crypttab.

   The functions also check whether any of the block devices etc that
   are to be cleaned are in active use before making any changes.
