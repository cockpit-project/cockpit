[[cockpit-tls-description]]
== DESCRIPTION

The `cockpit-tls` program is a TLS terminating HTTP proxy for
`cockpit-ws(8)`. It manages a set of isolated cockpit-ws instances, one
per TLS client certificate, plus one for TLS without a client
certificate, and one for unencrypted HTTP. With that, one session cannot
tamper with another one through possible security vulnerability
exploits.

Users or administrators should never need to start this program as it
automatically started by `systemd(1)` via socket activation.

[[cockpit-tls-transport]]
== TRANSPORT SECURITY

To specify the TLS certificate the web service should use, simply drop a
file with the extension `.cert` in the `/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d`
directory, or below `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` if set (see
link:./cockpit.conf.5.html[cockpit.conf]). If there are multiple files
in this directory, then the highest priority one is chosen after
sorting.

The `.cert` file should contain at least two OpenSSL style PEM blocks.
First one or more `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` blocks for the server certificate
and intermediate certificate authorities and a second one containing a
`BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` or similar. The key must not be encrypted.

If there is no TLS certificate, a self-signed certificate is
automatically generated using `sscg` (if available) or `openssl` and
stored in the `0-self-signed.cert` file.

When enrolling into a FreeIPA domain, an SSL certificate is requested
from the IPA server and stored in `10-ipa.cert`.

To check which certificate `cockpit-ws` will use, run the following
command.

....
$ sudo /usr/libexec/cockpit-certificate-ensure --check
....

Or, on Debian-based systems:

....
$ sudo /usr/lib/cockpit/cockpit-certificate-ensure --check
....

If using `certmonger` to manage certificates, following command can be
used to generate a certificate/key pair:

....
CERT_FILE=/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/50-certmonger.crt
KEY_FILE=/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/50-certmonger.key

getcert request -f ${CERT_FILE} -k ${KEY_FILE} -D $(hostname --fqdn)
....

[[cockpit-tls-options]]
== OPTIONS

`--help`::
  Show help options.
`--port` <PORT>::
  Serve HTTP requests on <PORT> instead of port 9090. Usually Cockpit is
  started on demand by `systemd` socket activation, and this option has
  no effect. Update the `ListenStream` directive `cockpit.socket` file
  in the usual `systemd` manner.
`--no-tls`::
  Don't use TLS. Certificates will not be read, and https connections
  denied. Then `cockpit-tls` will only manage a single cockpit-ws
  instance, and thus not do anything different than running
  `cockpit-ws --no-tls` directly. Only use this for debugging or
  testing.
`--idle-timeout` <SECONDS>::
  If greater than 0, exit if no connections have happened for the given
  number of seconds, i. e. the server is idle. If not given, the default
  is 90.

[[cockpit-tls-environment]]
== ENVIRONMENT

The `cockpit-tls` program expects the `RUNTIME_DIRECTORY` environment
variable to be set to an empty directory (preferably in `/run/`) that is
only accessible by the system user under which it is running. This
contains the Unix sockets for communicating with the `cockpit-ws`
instances, and in the future, state information about client
certificates. This variable is normally set by the `cockpit.service`
systemd unit.

In addition, `cockpit-tls` will use the `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` environment
variable from the
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG
basedir spec] to find its certificates and the `cockpit.conf(5)`
configuration file.
