#    containers/flatpak/install [extra opts...]
#
# If [extra opts...] are specified, they are passed directly to
# flatpak-builder, eg: --user.
#
# If the TARBALL environment variable is set, the named tarball will be used
# instead of running `make dist`.  URLBASE can also be set.  See the comment in
# containers/flatpak/prepare for more information about those.
