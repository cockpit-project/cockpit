# Anaconda's tests are "special" (require booting boot.iso, can't run in
# tmt/Testing Farm), so we need to run them in Cockpit's CI. But we still want
# to re-use the packit COPR, which is much easier to consume by Anaconda's
# tests than building cockpit in Anaconda.
# This workflow checks if the PR affects Anaconda (changes to the bridge or
# Storage page), polls the packit COPR until it has the current PR version
# available, and then test-triggers a "cockpit PR" scenario.
