== Synopsis

*cockpit-bridge* [*--help*] [*--packages*]

[[cockpit-bridge-description]]
== Description

The *cockpit-bridge* program is used by Cockpit to relay messages and
commands from the Web front end to the server. Among other things it
relays DBus, and spawns processes on behalf of the Web user interface.

This program is not routinely run by users or administrators. It is in
the *$PATH* so that Cockpit can find it when connecting between hosts.
However there are some diagnostics available when running from the
command line.
