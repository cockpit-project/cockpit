== Name

pam_ssh_add - PAM module to auto load ssh keys into an agent

[[pam-ssh-add-description]]
== Description

*pam_ssh_add* provides authentication and session modules that allow users
to start their session with a running ssh-agent with as many ssh keys
loaded as possible.

If used, the authentication module simply stores the authentication
token for later use by the session module. Because this module performs
no actual authentication it returns PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT on success and
should always be accompanied by an actual authentication module in your
pam configuration.

By default the session module will start a new ssh-agent and run
ssh-add, loading any keys that exist in the default path for the newly
logged in user. If any keys prompt for a password, and a authentication
token was successfully stored, that token will be provided as the
password.
