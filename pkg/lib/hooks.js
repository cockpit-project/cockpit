/* HOOKS
 *
 * These are some custom React hooks for Cockpit specific things.
 *
 * Overview:
 *
 * - usePageLocation: For following along with cockpit.location.
 *
 * - useLoggedInUser: For accessing information about the currently
 * logged in user.
 *
 * - useFile: For reading and watching files.
 *
 * - useObject: For maintaining arbitrary stateful objects that get
 * created from the properties of a component.
 *
 * - useEvent: For reacting to events emitted by arbitrary objects.
 *
 * - useInit: For running a function once.
 *
 * - useDeepEqualMemo: A utility hook that can help with things that
 * need deep equal comparisons in places where React only offers
 * Object identity comparisons, such as with useEffect.
 */

/* - usePageLocation()
 *
 * function Component() {
 *   const location = usePageLocation();
 *   const { path, options } = usePageLocation();
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * This returns the current value of cockpit.location and the
 * component is re-rendered when it changes. "location" is always a
 * valid object and never null.
 *
 * See https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit-location.html

/* - useLoggedInUser()
 *
 * function Component() {
 *   const user_info = useLoggedInUser();
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * "user_info" is the object delivered by cockpit.user(), or null
 * while that object is not yet available.

/* - useDeepEqualMemo(value)
 *
 * function Component(options) {
 *   const memo_options = useDeepEqualMemo(options);
 *   useEffect(() => {
 *       const channel = cockpit.channel(..., memo_options);
 *       ...
 *       return () => channel.close();
 *   }, [memo_options]);
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * function ParentComponent() {
 *     const options = { superuser: true, host: "localhost" };
 *     return <Component options={options}/>
 * }
 *
 * Sometimes a useEffect hook has a deeply nested object as one of its
 * dependencies, such as options for a Cockpit channel.  However,
 * React will compare dependency values with Object.is, and would run
 * the effect hook too often.  In the example above, the "options"
 * variable of Component is a different object on each render
 * according to Object.is, but we only want to open a new channel when
 * the value of a field such as "superuser" or "host" has actually
 * changed.
 *
 * A call to useDeepEqualMemo will return some object that is deeply
 * equal to its argument, and it will continue to return the same
 * object (according to Object.is) until the parameter is not deeply
 * equal to it anymore.
 *
 * For the example, this means that "memo_options" will always be the
 * very same object, and the effect hook is only run once.  If we
 * would use "options" directly as a dependency of the effect hook,
 * the channel would be closed and opened on every render. This is
 * very inefficient, doesn't give the asynchronous channel time to do
 * its job, and will also lead to infinite loops when events on the
 * channel cause re-renders (which in turn will run the effect hook
 * again, which will cause a new event, ...).

/* - useFile(path, options)
 * - useFileWithError(path, options)
 *
 * function Component() {
 *   const content = useFile("/etc/hostname", { superuser: "try" });
 *   const [content, error] = useFileWithError("/etc/hostname", { superuser: "try" });
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * The "path" and "options" parameters are passed unchanged to
 * cockpit.file().  Thus, if you need to parse the content of the
 * file, the best way to do that is via the "syntax" option.
 *
 * The "content" variable will reflect the content of the file
 * "/etc/hostname". When the file changes on disk, the component will
 * be re-rendered with the new content.
 *
 * When the file does not exist or there has been some error reading
 * it, "content" will be false.
 *
 * The "error" variable will contain any errors encountered while
 * reading the file.  It is false when there are no errors.
 *
 * When the file does not exist, "error" will be false.
 *
 * The "content" and "error" variables will be null until the file has
 * been read for the first time.
 *
 * useFile and useFileWithError are pretty much the same. useFile will
 * hide the exact error from the caller, which makes it slightly
 * cleaner to use when the exact error is not part of the UI. In the
 * case of error, useFile will log that error to the console and
 * return false.

 *                         [param], [deep_equal])
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * This will call "create_object(param)" before the first render of
 * the component, and will call "obj.close()" after the last render.
 *
 * More precisely, create_object will be called as part of the first
 * call to useObject, i.e., at the very beginning of the first render.
 *
 * When "param" changes compared to the previous call to useObject
 * (according to the deep_equal function in the example above), the
 * object will also be destroyed and a new one will be created for the
 * new value of "param" (as part of the call to useObject).
 *
 * There is no time when the "obj" variable is null in the example
 * above; the first render already has a fully created object.  This
 * is an advantage that useObject has over useEffect, which you might
 * otherwise use to only create objects when dependencies have
 * changed.
 *
 * And unlike useMemo, useObject will run a cleanup function when a
 * component is removed.  Also unlike useMemo, useObject guarantees
 * that it will not ignore the dependencies.
 *
 * The dependencies are an array of values that are by default
 * compared with Object.is.  If you need to use a custom comparator
 * function instead of Object.is, you can provide a second
 * "comparators" array that parallels the "dependencies" array.  The
 * values at a given index in the old and new "dependencies" arrays
 * are compared with the function at the same index in "comparators".
