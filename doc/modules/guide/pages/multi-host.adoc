[[multi-host]]
= Managing multiple hosts at the same time

[WARNING]
====
This feature is deprecated as of Cockpit 322.

Cockpit allows you to access multiple hosts in a single session, by
establishing SSH connections to other hosts. This is quite similar to
logging into these other hosts using the `+ssh+` command on the command
line, with one very important difference:

Code from the local host and all the remote hosts run at the same time,
in the same browser context. They are not isolated from each other in
the browser. All code effectively has the same privileges as the primary
session on the local host.

Thus, _you should only only connect to remote hosts that you trust_. You
must be sure that none of the hosts that you connect to will cause
Cockpit to load malicious JavaScript code into your browser.

Therefore, Cockpit will warn you before connecting to more than one
host. It is also possible to disable multiple hosts entirely, and some
operating systems do this already by default.

You can prevent loading of JavaScript, HTML, etc from more than one host
by adding this to `+cockpit.conf+`:

....
    [WebService]
    AllowMultiHost=false

....

When you allow multiple hosts in a single Cockpit session by setting
`+AllowMultiHost+` to true, then the user will be warned once per
session, before connecting to the second host. If that is still too
much, you can switch the warning off completely by adding the following
to `+cockpit.conf+`:

....
    [Session]
    WarnBeforeConnecting=false
....
